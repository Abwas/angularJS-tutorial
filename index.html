  <!-- Putting ng-app='myApp' is a custom attribute and says evertyhing inside the body tags is now
  connected to our variable we used in the global namespace. This needs to be the same as the string we assigned in our module  -->
  <!-- ng-app is a directive, directives allow us to extend HTML by adding attributes, elements or comments -->
  <body ng-app='myApp'>
    <!-- Now ng-cotroller looks for any name called 'mainCtrl' on 'myApp' module which we declared as app in our app.js -->
    <div ng-controller='mainCtrl'>
      <!-- angular uses a view model with data binding, it makes a empty view value then fills it with the name property -->
      <h2> Hello {{name}} </h2>
      <!-- {{name}} is a data binding expresion -->
    </div>
